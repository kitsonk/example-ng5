# example-ng5

This project is an example of integrating [The Intern](https://theintern.io) into an Angular 5 project, while still preserving as much of the Angular CLI functionality. The project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.7.3, and then modified to integrate Intern.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `output/dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `npm test` to execute the unit tests via [The Intern](https://theintern.io/).
